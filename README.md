# 002-Direct-Cache-Mapping-Simulation
Simulates the behaviour of a Direct Cache Mapping memory architecture, in C.
It analyses a given set of memory access data from a bubble-sorting algorithm and collects event data,
like cache hits and, cache misses, over different variations of the cache setup (e.g. size of cache block, number of cache blocks)
